---+ Solr Plugin
%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ About Solr
Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the Lucene Java search
library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search,
caching, replication, and a web administration interface. It runs in a Java
servlet container such as Tomcat. 

This extension comes with a preconfigured jetty configurd to run a Solr webapp
right away.

---++ Installation
First follow the normal plugin instructions as follows.
%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---+++ Downloading !SolrPlugin-bin

!SolrPlugin is distributed in two parts:

   1 !SolrPlugin: the Foswiki specific part and 
   2 !SolrPlugin-bin: java binary package containing the latest stable solr, jetty and other required jar packages

Both have to be downloaded and installed. They are available at Foswiki:Extensions/SolrPlugin.
After downloading both have to be unpacked in your Foswiki installation directory (&lt;foswiki-dir>).
The reason for this split is to provide one light-weighted Foswiki plugin in terms of download size, whereas the
!SolrPlugin-bin part comprises the most current stable release of solr. The bin part will most likely only
change when there is a new release of the solr software itself, whereas the Foswiki part might change more often.
So you won't need to download !SolrPlugin-bin yet again when upgrading !SolrPlugin.

---+++ Starting the Solr webservice
The !SolrPlugin will send all content to be indexed to a Solr webservice via HTTP.
So you will need to install a Solr webservice in a servlet container
of your choice, e.g. [[http://tomcat.apache.org/][tomcat]] or [[http://jetdfty.codehaus.org/jetty/][jetty]]. 

!SolrPlugin comes with a ready-to use jetty engine configured
to start a Solr server on the host the Foswiki engine is running. 
This can be either started manually using the =solrstart= tool or be launched automatically
if !SolrPlugin can't ping the server. 

By default Solr listens to port 8983 on the localhost and is configured to only
allow connections from localhost for security reasons. You can change these
settings in

<verbatim>
<foswiki-dir>/solr/etc/jetty.xml
</verbatim>

After checking these settings start the Solr daemon in the background using

<verbatim>
<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrstart
</verbatim>

Make sure that Foswiki is configured to contact the Solr server at the correct 
url in [[%SCRIPTURL{"configure"}%][configure]]. 

Now test that SolrSearch is working fine. Note that it won't show any search results
by now as we didn't index any content yet.

---+++ Setting up separate cores for virtual hosting

!SolrPlugin supports virtual hosting using Foswiki:Extensions/VirtualHostingContrib by assigning a separate "core" to each
virtual host. This ensures that indexes are created for each virtual host separately and content from one host does not leak to another while still using a single solr service answering queries for all virtual hosts installed.

Multiple cores are located in sub-directories under =../solr/multicore/=. By default !SolrPlugin comes with a predefined 
core named "foswiki". All data of this core is thus stored in the =.../solr/multicore/foswiki/= directory. All cores
have got separate URLs to access them:

<verbatim>
http://<server-name>:<port>/solr/<core-name>
</verbatim>

To create a new core, copy the =.../solr/multicore/_template= directory to a new directory under the multicore directory, e.g. =../solr/multicore/mydomain.com= All known cores are listed in the =../solr/multicore/solr.xml= file. So adding
your new =mydomain.com= core alter this file to:

<verbatim class="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<solr persistent="false" sharedLib="lib">
  <cores adminPath="/admin/cores" sharedSchema="true">
    <core name="foswiki" instanceDir="foswiki" /> <!-- default core -->
    <core name="mydomain.com" instanceDir="mydomain.com" /> <!-- additional core for mydomain.com -->
    <!-- ... other cores ... -->
  </cores>
</solr>
</verbatim>

You are required to restart the solr server when you make any changes to the =solr.xml= file. Test if your new core is available by accessing the admin
console.

<verbatim>
http://<server-name>:<port>/solr/<core-name>/admin
</verbatim>

Note: depending on your tomcat or jetty configuration access to this port might be restricted.
In this case use the =..&lt;foswiki-dir>/tools/virtualhost-solrsearch= tool to make a basic query.

<verbatim>
cd ..<foswiki-dir>/tools
./virtualhost-solrsearch host=mydomain.com
</verbatim>

Use the =host= parameter to access other virtual hosts.

There is a set of additional tools that have a variation for a virtual host setup:

   * virtualhost-solrsearch
   * virtualhost-solrindex
   * virtualhost-solrdelete

The =solrjob= tool itself is a wrapper around the =solrindex= and will either use =solrindex= or =virtualhost-solrindex=
depending on the =host= commandline parameter.

---+++ Indexing existing content offline
Before using SolrSearch you will need to index your content completely. Afterwards
Foswiki will keep the index up-to-date whenever you change a topic or upload another attachment.

Let's first test if the indexer is working fine by indexing a single topic:

<verbatim>
<foswiki-dir>/tools/virtualhost-solrindex topic=Main.WebHome
</verbatim>

Now check if this topic shows up in SolrSearch.

If that worked out fine go for the complete thing:

<verbatim>
<foswiki-dir>/tools/virtualhost-solrindex host=<core-name> mode=full optimize=on
</verbatim>

Replace &lt;core-mame> with the name of your virtual host, or with "foswiki" to access the pre-defined default
core.

This will crawl all webs, topics and attachment and submit them to the Solr server which in turn
will build up the search index. This can take a while depending on the amount of content and number of users
registered to your site already. During this process attachments are "stringified" using the StringifierContrib, that is
they are converted into a plain text format that Solr can read. !SolrPlugin will cache
the stringified version of all attachments and only process them again if the corresponding
binary version has changed. Thus a next full index run will process significant faster.

!SolrPlugin does read the access rights of all users to a document while indexing it.
This access control information is indexed together with the document to secure entries
in the database. Any request will take these under consideration so that only users with
view rights to a document can retrieve it using !SolrSearch.

---+++ Setting up immediate indexing
Whenever a topic or attachment in Foswiki changes, solr has to read the changed documents and update
its index. This can either be done immediately when a topic is saved, an attachment is uploaded or moved
to a different location. This can be configured to your needs:

Enable/disable updates on save:
<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnSaveUpdates} = 0;
</verbatim>

Enable/disable updates when a new attachment has been uploaded:
<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnUploadUpdates} = 0;
</verbatim>

Enable/disable updates when a topic or attachment has been moved or deleted:
<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnRenameUpdates} = 1;
</verbatim>

All but the latter are disabled by default. That's because updating solr's index might take a noticable amount of time
when clicking on "save" in the wiki editor, even more when the saved topic has got a lot of attachments as when the topic updates all of its attachments are reindexed as well.

The =EnableOnRenameUpdates= is _enabled_ by default as this does influence the solr index and the way it displays search results significantly. 

---+++ Setting up offline indexing
In any case it is strongly recommended to *fully reindex* all of your documents regularly, presumably every 24h at night.
To achieve this install a cron-job like this one:

<verbatim>
0 0 * * * <foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --mode full --hosts all
</verbatim>

%RED%host=all for vhost, else normal%ENDCOLOR%

This will read all existing webs one by one and re-index all topics and attachments. Afterwards the index is optimized for size and performance.

In addition you'd like to set up *delta indexing* in a rather short term, by reindexing all documents that changed since
the last time the delta indexing was performed. This is set up using a cron job like this:

<verbatim>
0-59/5 * * * * <foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --mode delta --hosts all
</verbatim>

This will start =solrindex= in delta mode every 5 minutes. You could even think about shortening this interval even more. However 5 minutes seems to be a good tradeoff of wasting resources vs. having all content updated in a timely manner. 

Instead of waiting for cron to trigger the delta indexing job, [[http://iwatch.sourceforge.net/][iwatch]] is a much better alternative giving you near-realtime indexing. Iwatch is available on linux systems that implement the inotify kernel service. That way the underlying operating system will trigger the =solrjob= script as soon as a file has changed. An example of an =iwatch.xml= file triggering a delta index job looks like this:

<verbatim>
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "/etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd" >

<config>
  <guard email="root@localhost" name="IWatch"/>
  <watchlist>
    <title>Foswiki</title>
    <contactpoint email="root@localhost" name="Administrator"/>
    <path type="recursive" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su www-data -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --host mydomain.com'"><vhosts-dir>/mydomain.com/data</path>
    <!-- add other virtual hosts here -->
    <path type="regexception">\.sw\w|\.svn|\.lease|\.lock|,$|\.changes|,v|^_[0-9]</path>
  </watchlist>
</config>
</verbatim>

Make sure to replace =&lt;foswiki-dir>=, =&lt;httpd-user>= and =&lt;vhosts-dir>= with the appropriate values on your platform.

Note that delta indexing is strongly recommended when one of the settings =EnableOnSaveUpdates=, =EnableOnUploadUpdates= or =EnableOnRenameUpdates= is disabled.

---++ Usage

In general it is recommended to replace Foswiki's default !AutoViewTemplatePlugin with Foswiki:Extensions/AutoTemplatePlugin. This will allow you to replace the default WebSearch, WebSearchAdvanced, WebChanges and %SYSTEMWEB%.SiteChanges with a solr-driven interface for better usability and performance.

Configure !AutoTemplatePlugin by adding the following ={ViewTemplateRules}=

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{AutoTemplatePlugin}{ViewTemplateRules} = {
...
  'WebSearchAdvanced' => 'SolrSearchView',
  'WebSearch' => 'SolrSearchView',
  'WebChanges' => 'WebChangesView',
  'SiteChanges' => 'SiteChangesView',
...
};
</verbatim>

You might also override the !WebSearch of an individual web using a rule along the following lines:

<verbatim>
   'MyWeb.WebSearch' => 'SolrSearchView'
</verbatim>

---+++ Macros

SolrPlugin comes with a set of search macros tailored to the extensive capabilities of solr's responses to search queries.
All of them make use of the same set of options to render a response as listed in [[#SOLRSEARCH][SOLRSEARCH]].

<a name="SOLRSEARCH"></a>
---++++ SOLRSEARCH

This is the most central macro of SolrPlugin. It allows to interact with the solr search server and display results within wiki applications. 
An example search looks like

<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"test"
  format="   1 $web.$topic$n"
  sort="date desc"
}%
</verbatim>

This will list the 10 most recently changed topics that match the string "test".
To list the 20 most recently changed topics topics that have the string "test" in their name use

<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"topic_search:test"
  format="   1 $web.$topic$n"
  sort="date desc"
  rows="20"
}%
</verbatim>

SOLRSEARCH allows you to use the full power of the lucene query language.
Consult the [[http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_1_0/queryparsersyntax.html][Lucene Query Syntax]] 
guide to learn more about how to form more complicated queries.

In addition to the full featured lucene query language SOLRSEARCH allows you to
run a query in "dismax" mode. The dismax query handler is a maximum tolerant
query processor that is robust against any sorts of user input to be fed to the
search engine. While the default lucene query handler comes will a quite
complex query language of itself, the dismax handler sacrifices this by aiming
for more robustness. 

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| id | a search can be cached optionally for the time of the current request, for example using id="solr1". further calls to %SOLRFORMAT can make use of the cached solr response to render it independent from the location of the %SOLRSEARCH call on the wiki page | |
| search | query string: depending on the search type this can either be a free-form text (type=dismax), a valid lucene query (type=standard) or a combination of both (edismax) | <nop>*:* |
| type | dismax/edismax/standard: query type | standard |
| fields | list of fields to be returned in the result; by default all fields in solr documents are returned; communication between Foswiki and the solr search can be optimized by specifying only those fields that you are interested in while rendering the response | *, score |
| *Flags:* |||
| jump | on/off: jump to the topic specified explicitly in the seach string  | on |
| lucky | on/off: jump to the first result found | off |
| highlight | switch on/off highlighting of found terms | off |
| spellcheck | switch on/off spellchecking to propose alternative spellings in case no search result was found | off | 
| *Pagination:* |||
| start | integer index within the result from where to start listing results | 0 |
| rows | maximum number of documents to return | 10 |
| *Filter parameters:* |||
| web | filter by web: this can be any webname | all |
| contributor | filter by contributor to a topic | |
| filter | lucene query to filter results | |
| extrafilter | additional lucene filter query (see %SYSTEMWEB%.SolrSearchBaseTemplate for the difference in =filter= and =extrafilter= | |
| reverse | on/off - reverts sorting if switched on; note: this overrides sorting order specified in =sort= | off |
| sort | sorting expression; examples: =score desc=, =date desc=, =createdate=, =topic_sort= | |
| *Dismax Parameter: |||
| boostquery | a raw query string (in the solr query syntax) that will be included with the user's query to influence the score. example: =type:topic^1000= will boost results of type topic | see solrconfig.xml and %System.SolrSearchBaseTemplate |
| queryfields | list of fields and their boosts giving each field a significance when a term was found in them. the format supported is fieldOne^2.3 fieldTwo fieldThree^0.4, which indicates that fieldOne has a boost of 2.3, fieldTwo has the default boost, and fieldThree has a boost of 0.4 ... this indicates that matches in fieldOne are much more significant than matches in fieldTwo, which are more significant than matches in fieldThree |  see solrconfig.xml and %System.SolrSearchBaseTemplate |
| phrasefields | list of fields and their boosts similar to =queryfields=. this parameter may contain fields and boosts that _pharses_ (specified in quotes) are matched against. boosting those fields higher than their counterpart in =queryfields= allows you to prefer phrase matches over separate word matches | see solrconfig.xml and %System.SolrSearchBaseTemplate |
| *Faceting:* |||
| facets | list of facets to be rendered during search; each facet can be a =title=name= pair specifying the facet name and the title label used to display it in the result; example: %BR% =%MAKETEXT<nop>{"Webs"}%=web, %MAKETEXT<nop>{"Applications"}%=field_TopicType_lst= | |
| facetquery | query to be used for a facet query | |
| facetoffset | used to page through a list of facets being returned by a search | |
| facetlimit | maximum number of values to be displayed per facet; this is a list of pairs =name=integer= specifying a per-facet limit; example: =50, tag=100, contributor=10, category=10= will constraint the global limit of facet values to be returned to 50, tags to 100, list the top 10 contributors in the hit set as well as the 10 most used categories | 100 |
| facetmincount | minimum frequency of a facet to be included in the result | 1 | 
| facetprefix | prefix string of a facet to be included | |

| facetdateother | part of a date facet describing the time intervals excluding the one specified with facetdatestart and facetdateend | before |
| hidesingle | comma separated list of facets to be hidden if there's only one choice left | | 
| disjunctivefacets | list of facets that are queried using OR; so searching within one facet will _expand_ the search instead of drilling down | facet values are combined using AND | 
| combinedfacets | list of facets where values are queried in each of them using OR; for example listing =field_ProjectMembers_lst= and =field_ProjectManager_s= will result in a lucne filter of the form =field_ProjectMembers_lst:%WIKINAME% OR field_ProjectManager_s:%WIKINAME%= | | 
| *Formating results:* ||| 
| correction | format string for corrections proposed by the spellchecker | Did you mean &lt;a href='$url'>$correction&lt;/a> |

| exclude_&lt;facet> | regular expression facet values must _not_ match to be displayed | |

<!--
| morelikethis | switch on/off more-like-this results per document found | off |
-->

---++++ SOLRFORMAT

When a solr response has been cached using the =id= parameter to [[#SOLRSEARCH][SOLRSEARCH]], it can be reused by subsequent calls to %SOLRFORMAT.

<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"test" 
  id="solr1"
  facets="web,contributor"
  facetlimit="web=10, contributor=10"
}%

<noautolink>
*Results:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format="   1 [[$web.$topic][$topic]]$n"
}%

*Webs:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format_web="   * $key ($count)$n"
}%

*Contributors:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format_contributor="   * $key ($count)$n"
  exclude_contributor="UnknownUser|AdminGroup|AdminUser|RegistrationAgent|TestUser"
}%
</noautolink>
</verbatim>

---++++ SOLRSIMILAR

SOLRSIMILAR allows to return a list of similar topics given the current one.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." | query string referencing the document(s) to return similar ones for | =id:%BASEWEB%.%BASETOPIC% |

---++ Solr indexing schema

!SolrPlugin comes with a custom schema to index general Foswiki data as defined
in the =&lt;solr-home-dir>conf/schema.xml= file. It offers support for generic
!DataForm values, so adding any new !DataForm definition will allow to use
those formfields for faceting directly without changing configurations or having to reindex 
the content. 

The process of indexing content is configured on the Foswiki side which will crawl all webs, topics
and their attachments thus creating lucene documents which are then sent over to the solr server.
A lucene document is made up of fields of a certain type which defines the way the document should be processed
by the solr server. This is configured in the =schema.xml= file.

While the schema is able to cover all Foswiki related data it is still kept generic enough to be used for non-wiki
content as well. Different kinds of content are distinguished using the =collection= field (see below).

---+++ Field types

This is the list of the most common field types used in the default schema.
See the =schema.xml= for more exotic field types like =point= and =location=
useful for spacial search.

| *Type* | *Description* |
| string | not analyzed, but indexed/stored verbatim |
| boolean | boolean values (true, false) |
| binary | the data should be sent/retrieved in as Base64 encoded strings |
| int, float, long, double | default numeric field types. for faster range queries, consider the tint/tfloat/tlong/tdouble types |
| date | the format for this date field is of the form 1995-12-31T23:59:59Z, \
         and is a more restricted form of the canonical representation of \
         [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime][dateTime]].  The trailing \
         "Z" designates UTC time and is mandatory.  Optional fractional seconds \
         are allowed: 1995-12-31T23:59:59.999Z All other components are \
         mandatory. Note: for faster range queries, consider the tdate type |
| text_ws | a text field that only splits on whitespace for exact matching of words |
| text | a general text field that has reasonable, generic cross-language \
         defaults: it tokenizes with !StandardTokenizer, removes stop words from \
         case-insensitive "stopwords.txt", and down cases.  At query time only, it also \
         applies synonyms.|
| text_generic | same as =text= but also splits words on case change while generating word parts. \
         a general unstemmed text field - good if one does not know the language of the field. \
         this field type is usful when searching for parts of a !WikiWord |
| text_substring | same as =text_generic= but with substring decomposition |
| text_spell | generic text analysis for spell checking |
| text_sort | this is a text field suitable for sorting alphabetically |
| text_rev | a general unstemmed text field that indexes tokens normally and also \
         reversed, to enable more efficient leading wildcard queries. |
| type | a text field used to analyse different content type; Type mappings are defined in =typemaping.txt=; for example, that's where all image file extension are mapped to "image", same for "video" |

---+++ Fields

| *Name* | *Type* | *Multivalued* | *Stored* | *Description* |
| timestamp | tdate | | stored | time when the document was added to the index |
| spell | text_spell | multivalued | | used for spellchecking |
| id | string | | stored | unique identifier for each document; this is the _external_ id usable in applications; there's an internal solr document id not related to this field |
| collection | string | | stored | identifies a set of documents comming from the same content collection; by default all content stored in Foswiki (topics and attachments) is gathered in the =wiki= collection set in =Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{DefaultCollection}= |
| language | string | | stored | language of the current document; this is derived from  =Foswiki::cfg{Site}{Locale}= but may be overwritten using the =CONTENT_LANGUAGE= preference |
| url | string | | stored | url used to  access the document being indexed |
| type | type | | stored | holds the type facet of the document; this is "image" for all kinds of images, "video" for all kinds of videos, "topic" for Foswiki topics and the verbatim file extension for everything else; note: plugins like Foswiki:Extensions/MetaCommentPlugin might use specific types as well (like "comment" in this case) |
| web | string | | stored | name of the web this document is located in |
| topic | string | | stored | name of the topic |
| webtopic | string | | stored | concatenation of the web and topic part |
| access_granted | string | multivalued | | this field controls access of users to this topic or attachment in the search index; every query is augmented with an ACL check against this field; only users listed in this field are allowed view rights; special value is "all" when there are no view restrictions |
| title | string | | stored | title of a document; a topic title is read from a =TopicTitle= formfield, a =TOPICTITLE= preference variable or defaults to the =topic= name itself; for attachments this is the filename with the extension stripped off |
| summary | text_generic | | stored | this is a plainified summary of the topic text |
| author | string | | stored | the name of the user that changed the document most recently |
| contributor | string | multivalued | stored | list of users that contributed to this topic at some point in time |
| date | tdate | | stored | time the the document was changed last |
| version | float | | | current version of the topic |
| text | text_generic | | | document text |
| createauthor | string | | stored | author of the initial version of this document |
| createdate | tdate | | stored | date when the initial version of this document was created |
| catchall | text_generic | multivalued | stored | copy-field that gathers content from (allmost) all fields; this is the default search field for the "standard" query parser; note that fields to be queried can be configured per request using the "dismax" handler |
| substrings | text_substring | multivalued | | holds substring analysis of the most important search fields |
| phonetic | phonetic | multivalued | | holds the phonetic analysis of the most important search fields |

| parent | string | | stored | parent topic of the current topic |
| form | string | | stored | name of the form attached to the current topic |
| preference | string | multivalued | stored | this field catches all topic preferences. each preference is captured in a dynamic field as well (see dynamic fields below) |

| outgoing | string | multivalued | stored | list of all outgoing links; this information is used to detect backlinks |
| category | string | multivalued | stored | list of categories this document is in; note: this field will only be used if Foswiki:Extensions/ClassificationPlugin is installed; it will populate it with the list of all categories up to !TopCategory; content of this field is copied to =category_search= as well (see generic fields below) |
| tag | string | multivalued | stored | list of tags assigned to this document; note: this field will only be used if Foswiki:Extensions/ClassificationPlugin is installed; content of this field is copied to =category_search= as well (see generic fields below) |

---+++ Dynamic fields

Dynamic fields are generated based on the content properties of the document to
be indexed. Fields are specified using some kind of wildcard in =schema.xml=.
When a document is indexed, the wildcard will be expanded to create a proper
field name. Dynamic fields allow to apply specific ways of analyzing fields
based on their name, as well as cover fields that aren't known in advance, like
the name of all formfields of a !DataForm that ever could be invented.

When !SolrPlugin is about to index a !DataForm attached to a topic, it tries to
guess the data type of each formfield. Normally, Foswiki does not specify any
type information within a !DataForm definition. Exceptions are (1) date: these
are mapped to a *_dt field and (2) checkbox, select, radio, textboxlist: these
are potentially multi-value fields and are thus indexed in a *_lst field.

Every other formfield is stored into an *_s field as well as into a *_search field.
The former captures the exact content while the latter analyses the text more thoroughly
optimized for fuzzy searching.

!DataForm formfields are mapped to lucene document fields by prepending the =field_*=
prefix to prevent name clashes with other dynamic fields generated on the fly.
So for example a formfield =ProjectManager= will be stored in =field_ProjectManager_s= 
and =field_ProjectManager_search=. Likewise a select+multi formfield =ProjectMembers=
will be stored in =field_ProjectMembers_lst= as it is a multivalued field.

If a formfield name already comes with one of the below suffixes (_i, _l, _f, _dt, etc)
then this suffix will be used instead of any heuristics trying to derive the best 
field type for the lucene field. That way !DataForm fields although untyped by Foswiki
can be indexed type-specific nevertheless.

Similarly topic preferences are indexed using a =preference_*= prefix.


| *Name* | *Type* | *Multivalued* | *Stored* | *Description* |
| *_i | tint | | stored | fields with a _i suffix are indexed as an integer number |
| *_l | tlong | | stored | fields with a _l suffix are indexed as a long integer |
| *_f | tfloat | | stored | fields with a _f suffix are indexed as a float |
| *_d | tdouble | | stored | fields with a _f suffix are indexed as a double precision float |
| *_b | boolean | | stored | true, false |
| *_s | string | | stored | dynamic field for unanalyzed text |
| *_t | text_generic | | stored | generic text |
| *_dt | tdate | | stored | a dateTime value |
| *_lst | string | multivalued | stored | this field is used for any multi-valued formfield in !DataForms like, select, radio, checkbox, textboxlist |
| preference_* | string | | stored | preference values such as =preference_NAMEOFPREFERENCE_t= |
| *_search | text_generic | | stored | generic text, optimized for searching |
| *_sort | text_sort | | stored | text optimized for sorting alphabetically |

---+++ Copy fields

Finally, after having defined all field type there are some fields that are created by copying some
source field to a destination field using the =copyField= feature of solr. So while most of a lucene document
to be indexed is created by the crawler and indexer explicitly, some more are created automatically to facilitate
specific search applications. The destination fields are then analysed using the dynamic field definitions as given above.

| topic | topic_sort |
| title | title_sort |
