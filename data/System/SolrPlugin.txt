---++ About Solr
Solr is an open source enterprise search server based on the [[http://lucene.apache.org][Lucene]] Java search
library, with XML/HTTP and JSON APIs, hit highlighting, faceted search,
caching, replication, and a web administration interface.

---++ Installation

The below installation procedure assumes that you are going to install Solr as well as Foswiki on the same server using Linux.

---+++ Foswiki plugin installation
%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

---+++ Download Solr

The current plugin requires *Solr 5.0.0* or later.  Download it from the [[http://archive.apache.org/dist/lucene/solr/][Apache Archive]].

---+++ Extract software, create user, install system service

%JQREQUIRE{"chili"}%

<verbatim class="bash">
tar xzf solr-5.x.x.tgz solr-5.x.x/bin/install_solr_service.sh
cd solr-5.x.x/bin/
./install_solr_service.sh ../../solr-5.x.x.tgz
service solr stop
</verbatim>

---+++ Secure Solr access

... so that it only listening to the local loopback interface

   * edit =/var/solr/solr.in.sh=
   * add =SOLR_OPTS="$SOLR_OPTS -Djetty.host=localhost"=

---+++ Optionally relocate logs 

... from =/var/solr/logs= to =/var/log/solr=

<verbatim class="bash">
mv /var/solr/logs /var/log/solr
</verbatim>

   * edit =/var/solr/solr.in.sh=
   * disable garbage collection logs ... =GC_LOG_OPTS=
   * set =SOLR_LOGS_DIR=/var/log/solr=
   * edit =/var/solr/log4j.properties=
   * set =solr.log=/var/log/solr=

---+++ Install Foswiki configuration set

<verbatim class="bash">
cd /var/solr/data
cp -r <foswiki-dir>/solr/configsets .
cp -r <foswiki-dir>/solr/cores .
chown -R solr.solr .
</verbatim>

---+++ Start solr service again

<verbatim class="bash">
service solr start
</verbatim>

---+++ Test

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/tools
./solrindex topic=Main.WebHome
</verbatim>

... should produce =Indexing <nop>Main.WebHome=

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/bin
./rest /SolrPlugin/search
</verbatim>

... should return a JSON response from Solr showing the recently indexed topic

---+++ Skin integration

SolrPlugin comes with a skin overlay - called =solr= - that will replace the upper left search boxes in [[Foswiki:Extensions/PatternSkin][PatternSkin]] with a solr-driven auto-suggest search box. To switch that on use

<verbatim>   * Set SKIN = solr, pattern</verbatim>

in your %USERSWEB%.SitePreferences.

%X% Note that you won't need to enable the =solr= skin overlay in case you are using [[Foswiki:Extensions/NatSkin][NatSkin]] as it comes with support for SolrPlugin out of the box.

---++ Commandline scripts 

There is a set of tools to interact with the Solr index from the commandline. These can either be
used to index Foswiki manually - as we did in above tests - as well as for searching or deleting specific documents in the index.

The set of tools comes in two variants, one for normal single-host Foswiki installations and for virtual hosting using [[Foswiki:Extensions/VirtualHostingContrib][VirtualHostingContrib]]

The virtual-hosting aware scripts have a prefix =virtualhost-...= and take an optional =host=&lt;domain>= parameter to specify the virtual domain to interact with.
When not specified will the script be executed for each domain in turn as configured in =VirtualHostingContrib=. Only exception is =solrjob= (see below).

---+++ solrindex / virtualhosts-index

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/tools
./solrindex ...
</verbatim>

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =web="..."= | the web to be indexed; if undefined all webs will be indexed | all |
| =topic="&lt;web>.&lt;topic>"= | the topic to be indexed; use this parameter to index one specific topic | |
| =mode="full/delta"= | mode of operation: =full= will unconditionally index all content as specified by =web= or =topic=; =delta= will only index content that has changed since the last time the script was run | delta |
| =optimize="on/off"= | optimize the Solr database by de-fragmenting its internal segments for better performance; this is normally not required unless a full indexing of larger chunks of content is performed; note that optimizing the Solr index might require considerable time and I/O resources on the filesystem of the server | off |

---+++ solrdelete / virtualhosts-delete

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/tools
./solrdelete ...
</verbatim>

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =&lt;lucene-query>= | delete topics matching the query | do nothing |

For instance to empty your index completely use:

<verbatim class="bash">
./solrindex *:*
</verbatim>

---+++ solrjob

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/tools
./solrdelete ...
</verbatim>

This tool is a wrapper around =solrindex= and will use either =solrindex= or =virtualhost-solrindex=
depending on the =host= commandline parameter. It is mainly used in cronjobs or =iwatch= (see below).
In contrast to =solrindex= a locking & throttling strategy is used to prevent multiple indexers being started simulataneously.
This is usefull when firing up the indexer as part of =iwatch= monitoring filesystem changes in the Foswiki store. As these events
often come in bundles firing rapidly in a short period of time will only one indexing process be spawned for a given time span defined
by the =throttle= parameter to =solrhjob=. 

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| =-f / --file &lt;file-path>= | index the topic that the given file points to | |
| =-h / --host &lt;virtual-domain>= | specifies the virtual domain to operate on (only makes sense when running !VirtualhostingContrib); Or specify =all= to perform the operation on all known virtual hosts | |
| =-m / --mode full/delta= | mode of operation (see =solrindex= above) | delta |
| =-t / --throttle &lt;seconds>= | number of seconds to wait until the indexing process is started; note that any other calls to =solrjob= are prevented from entering the indexing loop as well | 5 |

---+++ rest /SolrPlugin/search

<verbatim class="bash">
cd <foswiki-dir>/bin
./rest /SolrPlugin/search ...
</verbatim>

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |

---++ Setting up an indexing strategy

Before using SolrSearch and get back results you will need to index your content completely and do so repeatedly to keep up with changes in the Foswiki content base.
This is basically achievable in various ways:

   1 full indexing: index all of the content from start to end
   2 delta indexing: index topics that changed since the last time (delta) indexing was performed
   3 realtime indexing: monitor changes in the Foswiki store and fire up indexing as close to the actual change event as possible
   4 online indexing: index content changes as part of the content being saved

We will discuss these strategies and line out their advantages. A combination of a few of the above ways will then make up the recommended indexing strategy for Foswiki content.

---+++ Full indexing

<verbatim class="bash">
./solrindex mode=full optimize=on
</verbatim>

This will crawl all webs, topics and attachment and submit them to the Solr server, which will build up the search index. This can take a considerable amount of time 
depending on the amount of content and number of users registered to your site, so you may prefer to do it at a quiet time.

Note that full indexing is required the first time you installed !SolrPlugin. From there on will you be able to use delta indexing to update the index incrementally as
content changes in Foswiki. 

It is recommended to only perform a full indexing again once in a week or preferably in longer intervals.

---+++ Delta indexing

<verbatim class="bash">
./solrindex 
</verbatim>

This will inspect all of the content base and check for changes since the last time the content was added to Solr. Any update content will be added to the index
as required. The delta indexing procedure will also look up all of the index and delete those documents from it where the original topic in the Foswiki content base
has been removed.

Delta indexing is a relatively fast operation that is best performed every 15 minutes or so. Don't shorten the intervals of delta indexing too much as that would
create additional load on the server where no content is found to be delta-indexed.

---+++ Realtime indexing

This mode of operation requires a separate service to be installed such as [[http://iwatch.sourceforge.net/][iwatch]].
Iwatch is a tool using the =inotify= kernel service of Linux systems to trigger a script based on events happening on the filesystem such as "file-open", "file-delete", "file-changed", "file-moved" etc.
Iwatch lets us hook in the =solrjob= script (see above) while watching events in the Foswiki data store at =&lt;foswiki-dir>/data/=

Note that this is only a "near-realtime" indexing behavior as the used script to perform the indexing is configured to throttle the procedure for a given
amount of time defaulting to 5 seconds. So any change to the content will then show up within 5 seconds after the event.

The service is configured by placing below configuration script at =/etc/iwatch/iwatch.xml=:

<verbatim class="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "/etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd" >

<config>
  <guard email="root@localhost" name="IWatch"/>
  <watchlist>
    <title>Foswiki</title>
    <contactpoint email="root@localhost" name="Administrator"/>
    <path type="recursive" filter=".*\.txt$" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su <httpd-user> -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob'"><foswiki-dir>/data</path>
    <path type="regexception">\.tmp|\.sw\w|\.svn|\.lease|\.lock|,$|\.changes|,v|^_[0-9]|^log|^Temporary|^UnitTestCheck</path>
  </watchlist>
</config>
</verbatim>

For !VirtualHostingContrib use:

<verbatim class="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<!DOCTYPE config SYSTEM "/etc/iwatch/iwatch.dtd" >

<config>
  <guard email="root@localhost" name="IWatch"/>
  <watchlist>
    <title>Foswiki</title>
    <contactpoint email="root@localhost" name="Administrator"/>

    <!-- watch directories shared among all virtual domains -->
    <path type="recursive" filter=".*\.txt$" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su <httpd-user> -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --host all'"><foswiki-dir>/data/System</path>
    <!-- <path type="recursive" filter=".*\.txt$" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su <httpd-user> -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --host all'"><foswiki-dir>/data/Applications</path> -->

    <!-- watch each virtual domain for changes -->
    <path type="recursive" filter=".*\.txt$" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su <httpd-user> -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --host <domain1>'"><vhosts-dir>/<domain1>/data</path>
    <!-- <path type="recursive" filter=".*\.txt$" alert="off" syslog="on" exec="su <httpd-user> -c '<foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --host <domain2>'"><vhosts-dir>/<domain2>/data</path> -->

    <path type="regexception">\.tmp|\.sw\w|\.svn|\.lease|\.lock|,$|\.changes|,v|^_[0-9]|^log|^Temporary|^UnitTestCheck</path>
  </watchlist>
</config>
</verbatim>

Make sure to replace 

   * =&lt;foswiki-dir>=
   * =&lt;httpd-user>= 
   * =&lt;domainX>= 
   * =&lt;vhosts-dir>= 

with the appropriate values on your platform.

Note in the latter example for an =iwatch.xml= configuration for virtual hosting that those webs shared among all domains (via soft links) must be watched separately
as changes to those directories don't appear as a change to the domains' directories. These are typically the [[%SYSTEMWEB%.%HOMETOPIC%]] and the Applications web in
case you installed [[Foswiki:Extensions/WikiWorkbenchContrib][WikiWorkbenchContrib]] and you'd like to share all wiki apps among all virtual domains.

---+++ Online indexing

This mode of operation refers to a way to update the search index _immediately_ as part of the =save= operation performed by Foswiki on behalf of the user.

The biggest advantage here is that changes to the content base will immediately show up in the search index reflecting the exact changes being made to the 
content base.

There are a couple of flags to switch on/off online indexing in your configuration.

Enable / disable indexing content as part of a =save= operation:

<verbatim class="perl">
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnSaveUpdates} = 0;
</verbatim>

Enable/disable updates when a new attachment has been uploaded:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnUploadUpdates} = 0;
</verbatim>

Enable/disable updates when a topic or attachment has been moved or deleted:

<verbatim>
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{EnableOnRenameUpdates} = 1;
</verbatim>

---+++ Setting up cronjobs

Below will set up performing 

   * a full indexing every Saturday midnight and
   * a delta indexing every 15 minutes

<verbatim class="cron">
0 0 * * 6 <foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --mode full
*/15 * * * * <foswiki-dir>/tools/solrjob --mode delta 
</verbatim>

%H% Add =--host all= to index all virtual hosts, or =--host &lt;hostname>= to index a single virtual host.

---+++ Recommendations

By now we are able to orchestrate a couple of ways how to keep up with changes in Foswiki while indexing it into an external database such as Solr.

There are a couple of pros and cons to keep in mind innate to every of the above methods. Also, your own business requirements might significantly shift any decision
how and when to schedule crawling the content. Some of the criteria to keep in mind are:

   * size of content base
   * speed of indexing content determined by server resources
   * interactive performance as perceived by the user
   * real-time requirements for updates in search results
   * changes in access control structures such as: 
      * new users being registered to Foswiki,
      * changing member ship in user groups,
      * changing clearance of user groups for specific content

---++++ What to keep in mind for full indexing

Especially changes in access control structures might affect clearance to content in a broader scale. As the indexing procedure caches the current authorization for a specific
piece of content along with it, will a change to _access control_ -- independent to any change of the _content_ itself -- render access control incorrect as cached into the Solr index
unless this content is indexed again. This is not a problem when the ACL of a single document is altered as this document is re-indexed again as part of the change event.
No such re-indexing is triggered automatically when a user group changes or is granted more or less authorization for content. This will indeed only be reflected the next
time a full indexing is performed. 

Access control structures might be changing totally outside of Foswiki when using [[Foswiki:Extensions][LdapContrib]] where users and groups are defined in a distant LDAP database.
These user and group records immediately affect Foswiki granting access to documents (there is some caching involved here as well, but let's ignore this for now). Only after
indexing affected documents _again_ will a search on the index exclude / include new content users have access to when visiting the page directly.

Therefore a regular full indexing is required, presumably once a week or once a day during off times.

The runtime of a full indexing run depends on the size of your content base as well as the size of the user base. Both directly affect the throughput indexing content.
It is strongly recommended to plan full indexing during off times when the system isn't used otherwise. Also, make sure that two full indexing runs don't overlap as that
would constantly increase load on the involved servers.

In those cases where a full indexing run over all of the content base exceeds off times (e.g. starting Friday night, doesn't finish on Monday morning) will you need to
add more server resources. There are multiple ways to do so. Step one would be to use separate servers for both Foswiki and Solr. Please read up on how to scale Solr beyond
a single-node installation as has been outlined in above configuration.

---++ Correctness of search index

A search index might show "incorrect" results for example when the content it indexes doesn't actually exist anymore. So users get a positive search hit but won't be able
to access the content anymore: both content base and search index are out of sync. Keeping the search index "correct" is of importance for any indexing strategy.

A search index might also be "incorrect" when it doesn't reflect the access rights a users has got on the content itself. That is: the search engine shall only return
search results for content that the user has clearance for. No such search result shall ever be returned for content that the user isn't allowed to access of even
get to know that it exists.

In !SolrPlugin any Foswiki ACLs are added to the Solr database while content is indexed. So ACLs are checked as an additional filter on any search operation that an
authenticated user might perform.

Correctness of the search index as we discuss it now is more concerned with the time it takes for to keep any content change in Foswiki in sync as it is being indexed and
added to the Solr database. 

There are two general categories for indexing content that we want to compare now: 

   * online indexing: index content as part of the interaction performed by the user
   * offline indexing: perform content indexing independent from the user interacting with the system online 

Offline indexing is performed by the =solrindex= script as well as the =solrjob= wrapper. Both might be used in a cronjob or =iwatch= as described above.

Looking at _online indexing_ there is a price in doing so that we should keep in mind before switching it on. 

Indexing will be  part of a =save=, =delete= or =rename= operation performed by the user
and thus directly increase the _perceived time for the user to interact with the system_ while applying content changes. 

You may decide yourself when trading interactive performance against negative side-effects due to "incorrect" search indexes. It is recommended to rather sacrifice 
a short period of time for the search index not being quite up-to-date rather than slowing down the interactive performance of the system by hooking the indexing procedure
into the online operations of Foswiki.

---++ Using Solr for WebSearch, WebChanges and %USERSWEB%.WikiUsers

It is recommended to replace Foswiki's default !AutoViewTemplatePlugin with [[Foswiki:Extensions/AutoTemplatePlugin][AutoTemplatePlugin]]. This will allow you to replace the default WebSearch, WebChanges and %SYSTEMWEB%.SiteChanges as well as %USERSWEB%.WikiUsers with a Solr-driven interface for better usability and performance. 

Configure !AutoTemplatePlugin by adding the following ={ViewTemplateRules}=

<verbatim class="perl">
$Foswiki::cfg{Plugins}{AutoTemplatePlugin}{ViewTemplateRules} = {
...
  'WebChanges' => 'WebChangesView',
  'SiteChanges' => 'SiteChangesView',
  'WebSearch' => 'SolrSearchView',
  'WikiUsers' => 'SolrWikiUsersView',
...
};
</verbatim>

The %SYSTEMWEB%.SolrWikiUsersViewTemplate implements a person search driven by Solr. It allows you to facet on properties as defined in the %SYSTEMWEB%.UserForm such as:

   * filter by location
   * filter by profession
   * filter by organization

There is a specific configuration option for Foswiki to detect which topics are actually user profile pages.

<verbatim class="perl">
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{PersonDataForm} = '(*UserForm)';
</verbatim>

Any topic that has got a =UserForm= attached to it will participate in the person search interface at %USERWEB%.WikiUsers. Note that the value at ={SolrPlugin}{PersonDataForm}= specifies a Solr filter query
that might be customized and extended as required. For example, to also include any topic that has got a =PersonTopic= DataForms attached to it use:

<verbatim class="perl">
$Foswiki::cfg{SolrPlugin}{PersonDataForm} = '(*PersonTopic OR *UserForm)';
</verbatim>

Finally, you'll need to make this configuration accessible in wiki applications such as the !WikiUsers view template. Add ='{SolrPlugin}{PersonDataForm}'= to the ={AccessibleCFG}= list as in

<verbatim class="perl">
$Foswiki::cfg{AccessibleCFG} = [
    '{ScriptSuffix}',
    '{LoginManager}',
    '{AuthScripts}',
...
    '{SolrPlugin}{PersonDataForm}',
];
</verbatim>

---++ Macros

SolrPlugin comes with a set of search macros tailored to the extensive capabilities of Solr's responses to search queries.
All of them make use of the same set of options to render a response as listed in [[#SOLRSEARCH][SOLRSEARCH]].

<a name="SOLRSEARCH"></a>
---++++ SOLRSEARCH

This is the most important macro. It allows you to interact with the Solr server and display results within wiki applications. 
An example search looks like this:
<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"test"
  format="   1 $web.$topic$n"
  sort="date desc"
}%
</verbatim>

This will list the 10 most recently changed topics that match the string "test".

To list the 20 most recently changed topics topics that have the string "test" in their name use:
<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"topic_search:test"
  format="   1 $web.$topic$n"
  sort="date desc"
  rows="20"
}%
</verbatim>

SOLRSEARCH allows you to use the full power of the Lucene query language. This
works with syntactically correct boolean queries like ="title:foo OR body:foo"=.
Consult the [[http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_1_0/queryparsersyntax.html][Lucene Query Syntax]] guide to learn more about how to form more complicated queries.

SOLRSEARCH also allows you to run a query in [[https://wiki.apache.org/solr/DisMaxQParserPlugin][dismax]] mode. The dismax query parser only supports a subset of the Lucene syntax, but is highly tolerant of all sorts of strange user input. The query syntax is uses is familiar to many search engine users, and supports +/- and quotes for groupings words. The =edismax= mode adds several more powerful features, though still short of what is offered by the full Lucene syntax.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |

---++++ SOLRFORMAT

When a solr response has been cached using the =id= parameter to [[#SOLRSEARCH][SOLRSEARCH]], it can be reused by subsequent calls to %SOLRFORMAT.

<verbatim class="tml">
%SOLRSEARCH{"test" 
  id="solr1"
  facets="web,contributor"
  facetlimit="web=10, contributor=10"
}%

<noautolink>
*Results:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format="   1 [[$web.$topic][$topic]]$n"
}%

*Webs:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format_web="   * $key ($count)$n"
}%

*Contributors:*
%SOLRFORMAT{"solr1"
  format_contributor="   * $key ($count)$n"
  exclude_contributor="UnknownUser|AdminGroup|AdminUser|RegistrationAgent|TestUser"
}%
</noautolink>
</verbatim>

---++++ SOLRSIMILAR

SOLRSIMILAR allows to return a list of similar topics given the current one.

| *Parameter* | *Description* | *Default* |
| "..." | query string referencing the document(s) to return similar ones for | =id:%BASEWEB%.%BASETOPIC%= | 
| like | list of fields used to compute similarity | category, tag |

---++ Solr indexing schema

!SolrPlugin comes with a custom schema to index general Foswiki data as defined
in the =&lt;solr-home-dir>conf/schema.xml= file. It offers support for generic
!DataForm values, so adding any new !DataForm definition will allow to use
those formfields for faceting directly without changing configurations or having to reindex 
the content. 

The process of indexing content is configured on the Foswiki side which will crawl all webs, topics
and their attachments thus creating lucene documents which are then sent over to the solr server.
A lucene document is made up of fields of a certain type which defines the way the document should be processed
by the solr server. This is configured in the =schema.xml= file.

While the schema is able to cover all Foswiki related data it is still kept generic enough to be used for non-wiki
content as well. 

---+++ Field types

This is the list of the most common field types used in the default schema.
See the =schema.xml= for more exotic field types like =point= and =location=,
useful for spatial search.

| *Type* | *Description* |
| string | not analyzed, but indexed/stored verbatim |
| boolean | boolean values (true, false) |
| binary | the data should be sent/retrieved in as Base64 encoded strings |
| int, float, long, double | default numeric field types. for faster range queries, consider the tint/tfloat/tlong/tdouble types |
| date | the format for this date field is of the form 1995-12-31T23:59:59Z, \
         and is a more restricted form of the canonical representation of \
         [[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlschema-2/#dateTime][dateTime]].  The trailing \
         "Z" designates UTC time and is mandatory.  Optional fractional seconds \
         are allowed: 1995-12-31T23:59:59.999Z All other components are \
         mandatory. Note: for faster range queries, consider the tdate type |
| text_ws | a text field that only splits on whitespace for exact matching of words |
| text | a general text field that has reasonable, generic cross-language \
         defaults: it tokenizes with !StandardTokenizer, removes stop words from \
         case-insensitive "stopwords.txt", and down cases.  At query time only, it also \
         applies synonyms.|
| text_generic | same as =text= but also splits words on case change while generating word parts. \
         a general unstemmed text field - good if one does not know the language of the field. \
         this field type is usful when searching for parts of a !WikiWord |
| text_substring | same as =text_generic= but with substring decomposition |
| text_spell | generic text analysis for spell checking |
| text_sort | this is a text field suitable for sorting alphabetically |
| text_rev | a general unstemmed text field that indexes tokens normally and also \
         reversed, to enable more efficient leading wildcard queries. |
| type | a text field used to analyse different content type; Type mappings are defined in =typemaping.txt=; for example, that's where all image file extension are mapped to "image", same for "video" |

---+++ Fields

| *Name* | *Type* | *Multivalued* | *Stored* | *Description* |
| timestamp | tdate | | stored | time when the document was added to the index |
| spell | text_spell | multivalued | | used for spellchecking |

| url | string | | stored | url used to  access the document being indexed |
| type | type | | stored | holds the type facet of the document; this is "image" for all kinds of images, "video" for all kinds of videos, "topic" for Foswiki topics and the verbatim file extension for everything else; note: plugins like Foswiki:Extensions/MetaCommentPlugin might use specific types as well (like "comment" in this case) |
| web | string | | stored | name of the web this document is located in |
| topic | string | | stored | name of the topic |
| webtopic | string | | stored | concatenation of the web and topic part |

| catchall | text_generic | multivalued | stored | copy-field that gathers content from (allmost) all fields; this is the default search field for the "standard" query parser; note that fields to be queried can be configured per request using the "dismax" handler |
| substrings | text_substring | multivalued | | holds substring analysis of the most important search fields |
| phonetic | phonetic | multivalued | | holds the phonetic analysis of the most important search fields |

| tag | string | multivalued | stored | list of tags assigned to this document; note: this field will only be used if Foswiki:Extensions/ClassificationPlugin is installed; content of this field is copied to =category_search= as well (see generic fields below) |
| name | string | | stored | filename of an attachment |
| comment | text_generic | | stored | comment field of an attachment | 
| size | tint | | stored | size of an attachment in bytes |

---+++ Dynamic fields

Dynamic fields are generated based on the content properties of the document to
be indexed. Fields are specified using some kind of wildcard in =schema.xml=.
When a document is indexed, the wildcard will be expanded to create a proper
field name. Dynamic fields allow to apply specific ways of analyzing fields
based on their name, as well as cover fields that aren't known in advance, like
the name of all formfields of a !DataForm that ever could be invented.

When !SolrPlugin is about to index a !DataForm attached to a topic, it tries to
guess the data type of each formfield. Normally, Foswiki does not specify any
type information within a !DataForm definition. Exceptions are (1) date: these
are mapped to a *_dt field and (2) checkbox, select, radio, textboxlist: these
are potentially multi-value fields and are thus indexed in a *_lst and *_msearch field.

Every other formfield is stored into an *_s field as well as into a *_search field.
The former captures the exact content while the latter analyses the text more thoroughly
optimized for fuzzy searching.

!DataForm formfields are mapped to lucene document fields by prepending the =field_*=
prefix to prevent name clashes with other dynamic fields generated on the fly.
So for example a formfield =ProjectManager= will be stored in =field_ProjectManager_s= 
and =field_ProjectManager_search=. Likewise a select+multi formfield =ProjectMembers=
will be stored in =field_ProjectMembers_lst= as it is a multivalued field.

If a formfield name already comes with one of the below suffixes (_i, _l, _f, _dt, etc)
then this suffix will be used instead of any heuristics trying to derive the best 
field type for the lucene field. That way !DataForm fields although untyped by Foswiki
can be indexed type-specific nevertheless.

Similarly topic preferences are indexed using a =preference_*= prefix.

| *Name* | *Type* | *Multivalued* | *Stored* | *Description* |
| *_i | tint | | stored | fields with a _i suffix are indexed as an integer number |
| *_l | tlong | | stored | fields with a _l suffix are indexed as a long integer |
| *_f | tfloat | | stored | fields with a _f suffix are indexed as a float |
| *_d | tdouble | | stored | fields with a _f suffix are indexed as a double precision float |
| *_b | boolean | | stored | true, false |
| *_s | string | | stored | dynamic field for unanalyzed text |
| *_t | text_generic | | stored | generic text |
| *_dt | tdate | | stored | a dateTime value |
| *_lst | string | multivalued | stored | this field is used for any multi-valued formfield in !DataForms like, select, radio, checkbox, textboxlist |
| preference_* | string | | stored | preference values such as =preference_NAMEOFPREFERENCE_t= |
| *_search | text_generic | | stored | generic text, optimized for searching |
| *_msearch | text_generic | multivalued | stored | generic text, optimized for searching |
| *_sort | text_sort | | stored | text optimized for sorting alphabetically |

Additionally some fields are created for easy displaying of values. All these fields are stored, unsafe characters =&lt;&gt;&quot;&#39;= are escaped and html comments =&lt;!-- ... --&gt;= are removed.

| *Name* | *Type* | *Multivalued* | *Stored* | *Description* |
| *_select_lst | string | multivalued | stored | in select+values formfields this stores the select string |
| *_escaped_lst | string | multivalued | stored | stores an escaped version of multivalued values |
| *_escaped_s | string | | stored | stores an escaped version of a string |

---+++ Copy fields

Finally, after having defined all field type there are some fields that are created by copying some
source field to a destination field using the =copyField= feature of solr. So while most of a lucene document
to be indexed is created by the crawler and indexer explicitly, some more are created automatically to facilitate
specific search applications. The destination fields are then analysed using the dynamic field definitions as given above.

| *Source* | *Destination* | 
| web | web_sort | 
| topic | topic_sort |
| title | title_sort |
| category | category_search |
| tag | tag_search |
| title | title_search |
| topic | topic_search |
| web | web_search |
| webtopic | webtopic_search |
| attachment | catchall | 
| category | catchall |
